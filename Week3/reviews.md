    - Eight - count reimplemented to be iterative instead of recursive using induction; sort implementation also contains loops and when it could be fully recursive.

    - Eight: Yes, except that the recursive_sort uses builtin max which is iterative and could have been implemented using induction to be recursive. (13/15)

    - Eight - Yes, the time stamp on the files is before 6:59am UTC the day of the due date.
    - Nine - Yes, the time stamp on the files is before 6:59am UTC the day of the due date. Note: I clicked "auto-format" by mistake editing the Nine.java file and updating its timestamp. I tried undoing but it bugged and instead of fixing the timestamp, it garbled small portions of the file so I had to fix those. Since, all this happened *after* I had already checked the timestamp and correctness, please assume it was submitted on time.
    - Ten - Yes, the time stamp on the files is before 6:59am UTC the day of the due date.

    - Ten - According to the professor, students who directly use APIs like flatMap, map, filter etc. were supposed to write comments in the code answering the question: where is the monad? No such explanation has been given. (5/15)
