### Correct - 20
- Yes, the programs produce the correct output for pride-and-prejudice.txt.
### Style - 45
- The program mostly honors the constraints and requirements of the corresponding style except that the leet code for the characters 'R' and 'M' seem to be incorrect. I'm not penalising for this - leaving that for the grader.
