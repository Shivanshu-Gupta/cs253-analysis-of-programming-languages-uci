- TwentyEight - Yes, the programs produce the correct output for pride-and-prejudice.txt.
### Style - 36
- TwentySeven - There seem to be a few violations of the style requirements. Most importantly, application data (columns) are leaked into the framework's update loop. (18/22.5)
- TwentyEight - The program doesn't seem to following the style requirement of using iterators. DataStorageManager is the only iterator. (18/22.5)

### Correct - 20
- TwentySeven - Yes, the programs produce the correct output for pride-and-prejudice.txt. 
- TwentyEight - Yes, the programs produce the correct output for pride-and-prejudice.txt.
### Style - 45
- TwentySeven - Yes, the program honors the constraints and requirements of the corresponding style.
- TwentyEight - Yes, the program honors the constraints and requirements of the corresponding style except that countAndSort does not return 5000 elements at a time. The person says that there's no way to do so in java but I think it might be possible (not certain) using iterators because I did it in scala using iterators. But I don't penalise for it and leave it to the grader.
