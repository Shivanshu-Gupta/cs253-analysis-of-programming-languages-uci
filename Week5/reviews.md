### Correct - 18
- Seventeen - There's a typo in the readme: it should be `pride-and-prejudice.txt` instead of `pride-and-prejudice`. Also, the name of the class was supposed to be given as input and not as command-line argument. Apert from these minor mistakes, the programs produce the correct output. (8/10)
