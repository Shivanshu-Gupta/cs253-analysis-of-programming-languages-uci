### Style - 45
- Twelve - Yes, the program honors the constraints and requirements of the corresponding style. (15/15)
- Thirteen - Yes, the program honors the constraints and requirements of the corresponding style. The attempt at the extra credit, however, doesn't seem correct as it's essentially just creating a wrapper around `this` that java already provides. In fact, the program still functions even if you replace all occurrences of `me` with `this`. (15/15)
- Fifteen - Yes, the program honors the constraints and requirements of the corresponding style. Although, stopWordFilter doesn't need to be passed to ZWordsCounter as the words are already non-stopwords. Could have been safely removed. (15/15)
